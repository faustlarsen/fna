      <h2>6 STEPS TO FINANCIAL SECURITY</h2>
    </div>
    <div id='homeContainer1'>
      <p><strong>Create an Emergency Fund</strong><br></br>
      Think about the three little pigs. One was ready for the unexpected. Two weren’t.
      To prepare for life’s big bad wolves, it’s important that you set up an emergency fund. It’s a designated stash of cash at your fingertips to help you recover from unforeseen expenses so you won’t derail your financial strategy or deplete your savings account.</p>
    </div>
    <div id='homeContainer1'>
      <p><strong>Apply Debt Management</strong><br></br>
      With financial protection in place and your emergency fund in the works, it’s time to face your debt.
      For many, it is THE greatest obstacle to a sound financial future and financial independence. Debt is a sweeping crisis perpetuated by a society of suckers led astray by the “instant gratification” desires of our generation.
      That’s a mouthful–but it’s true.</p>
    </div>
    <div id='homeContainer1'>
    <p><strong>Secure Proper Protection</strong><br></br>
      Proper protection of your income should be your first priority.
      Why? Because financial hardship after the loss of a job, business, business partner or spouse can be hard to recover from. To protect your income for all those who depend on you, sit down with your financial professional ASAP to talk about life insurance.
      Already have life insurance? When was the last time you had a review?</p>

      <p><strong>Increase Cash Flow</strong><br></br>
      Cash flow is the money you have available to spend or to save.
      After you have established financial protection, an emergency fund, and a debt strategy, you’re in a position to focus on your cash flow, which can help you eliminate debt and grow savings faster.
      The key to cash flow is examining, managing, and reducing expenses.</p>

    <div id='homeContainer1'>
      <p><strong>Build Your Wealth</strong><br></br>
      For many who have saved little to date, growing wealth may seem like pie in the sky. But it should be a commitment to get serious about as soon as possible.
      Knuckle down with your financial professional to begin your asset accumulation strategy so you can build wealth for both quality and longevity of life.
      Find out what your retirement numbers are – how much income you want to live on – and then set a goal and strategy to get there.</p>
    </div>
    <div id='homeContainer1'>
    <p><strong>Protect Wealth</strong><br></br>
      Having an estate plan in place is critical to protecting your wealth, so your assets end up in the hands of your loved ones—not in the control of the court system.
      Think it will be too expensive or time- consuming to get your estate plan done? Then you haven’t considered the cost and time it could steal from your loved ones down the road if you don’t.
      There’s no good reason to delay checking this final Milestone off the list. Do it immediately.</p>
